Resources-1.02
===============


INTRODUCTION

Resources.pm is Perl package used to specify configuration (defaults, ...)
parameters for Perl applications, pretty much in the same way as XWindows
does.  It implements dynamical inheritance of defaults (both values and names)
through subclassing, parameter loading from files, runtime parameter viewing
and editing. The package contains an extensive documentation in POD format, to
which you are kindly referred.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The package has been succesfully tested with both perl-5.002_01 and
perl-5.001. It will not work at all with perl4.

INSTALLATION

To install in your standard site_local perl lib tree, just do
the following

	% tar zxvf Resources-1.02.tar.gz
	% cd Resources-1.02
	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make install

See the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage for custom installation.

BUG REPORTS

The package is currently in beta version. Please send bug reports (including
a snippet of the code that evidentiated the bug) to
